## Course aims and objectives

Projects like [Photosynth](http://photosynth.net/), [Kinect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect), and [Tango](https://www.google.com/atap/projecttango/#project) have shown the incredible potential of using computer vision to construct immersive 3D environments from easily acquired imagery. In this lab-based class, we'll dive into practical applications of 3D reconstruction, combining hardware and software to build our own 3D environments from scratch. 

We'll use open-source frameworks like [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) to do the heavy lifting, with the focus on understanding and applying state-of-the art approaches to geometric computer vision. Along the way, we'll use industry standard revision management tools like [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [Github](http://github.com). The class will culminate in a final project of your choice that puts your new 3D reconstruction skills to use.

### Specific learning objectives
By the end of the class, you should be able to:
 1. Extract 3D information latent in 2D images and video.
 2. Apply state-of-the-art scientific libraries without needing a full grasp of their implementations.
 3. Use industry standard software engineering practices such as version control and peer code review.

## Class format
The class will be heavily project-based. Projects will be completed in small groups. I'll assign early projects with specific goals and evaluations. Your group will design the final project, which will occupy roughly the last third of the semester. 

We'll devote lots of in-class time to working on projects with the TA and I available to help. Each class may begin with a short presentation on a topic relevant to the current assignment. You should expect to spend time outside of class gaining additional background and practice with the topics covered by the projects.

## Course Schedule
This schedule is a living thing and may change as needed to accomodate the class's progress.

TBD

## Course requirements

### Attendance and Participation
Classtime will be largely devoted to working in small groups, when you'll have access to me and the TA. While attendance is not required, it's to your advantage to come to collaborate with your group and stay abreast of developments in the course schedule.

### Course materials
TBD: Links to book, OpenCV tutorials, etc.

### Grading
TBD: List of projects and weights.

### Programming Guidelines.
Assignments in this course will be completed in [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/).

Code style should follow the guidelines established in [PEP 8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [PEP 257](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).
