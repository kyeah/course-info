3D Reconstruction with Computer Vision
--------------------------------------
### CS 378 (53132), Fall 2014

Projects like [Photosynth](http://photosynth.net/), [Kinect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect), and [Tango](https://www.google.com/atap/projecttango/#project) have shown the incredible potential of using computer vision to construct immersive 3D environments from easily acquired imagery. In this lab-based class, we'll dive into practical applications of 3D reconstruction, combining hardware and software to build our own 3D environments from scratch. 

We'll use open-source frameworks like [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) to do the heavy lifting, with the focus on understanding and applying state-of-the art approaches to geometric computer vision. Along the way, we'll use industry standard revision management tools like [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [Github](http://github.com). The class will culminate in a final project of your choice that puts your new 3D reconstruction skills to use.
